    <h1>Box Sizing 2</h1>
    <h3>both of these boxes have their height and width set to 100px. But they are different?</h3>
    <h3>The first box does not have border-box applied in the box-sizing property</h3>
    <p>Box 1 is 10px bigger than Box 2 on all sides of the box (120 high and 120 wide) because the 10px border is not accounted within the 100px width and height specified below</p>
    <div class="box1"><p>BOX 1</p></div>
    <p>Box 2 is exactly 100px in height and width as specified, because the 10px border is taken into account due to the border-box value of the box-sizing property </p>
    <div class="box2"><p>BOX 2</p></div>
