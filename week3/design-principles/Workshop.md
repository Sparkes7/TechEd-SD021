# Design

# Branding

I want the game to be a minimalist, cosy feeling game and therefore the branding will be bright colours

# Type of Site

The point of the website is to catch fish -> therefore I am going to direct the user immediately to catch a fish
with a "Catch Fish" button in the middle of the screen

# User Flow

# Hierarchy

Right in the middle of the screen I want the main interaction of the game. In the bottom corner I want interactables but it will be something you see secondary to the main game.

# Consistency

# Balance

# Simplicity

# Contrast

# Imagery

# Typography

light simple typography to go with the minimalist nature of the overall design

# User Feedback

Hover states on buttons that the user can click on
