# Design principles

This is a theoretical approach to planning your website.
Find out what the point of the website is.

## What is the website about?

Write whats important to the website to coerce your design decisions

## User flow

map your users journey, from landing to the end goal.

- users have expectations
- wireframing can be helpful
- steer towards closure

Simplicity is key. Make actions simple to do and make them obvious how they can do it.

## Heirarchy

**The most important thing, is the most important thing**

- define the order of importance of info/items on your page
- nudge the user towards what they will probably want to do first by making it visually dominant
- decisiveness, contrast, emphasis, visual heirarchy.

## Consistency

**Your site visuals should maintain consistency so that users understand waht's going on**

Your buttons should be the same style so that the user recognises buttons
colours of elements should be consistent.

## Balance

**Use delightful spacing, alignment & placement**

- between page elements and elements themselves
- use of negative space
- don't use colour alone.

## Simplicity

**Keep things clear and straightforward for the user**

You should always try to convey the message with the least amount of content as possible.

- reduce cognitive load
  -- group elements together
  -- reduce the options for the user

# Stretch design principles

## Contrast

**for accessibility and emphasis**

- not only does sensible and defined use of contrast help make things more readable and accessible.
- but it also helps with distinguishing elements and creating emphasis.

## Imagery - Photos and Illustrations

**Add visual interest to your site**

- your content can be your imagery. Example: Cards with images
- creates emotional resonance with users
- imagery is communication
- imagery decisions and checks

## Typography

**refers to the way we select and arrange our 'type'**

- complimenting fonts
- consistency in colours, weight, style, decoration etc.
- neat alignment.

## User Feedback

**Gives a reaction for your users action**

- use hover, focus, active states
- make the user aware something is interactive
